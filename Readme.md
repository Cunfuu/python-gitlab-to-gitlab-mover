## Requirements
This script uses the python-gitlab library to interact with the GitLab APIs of both the source and destination instances. You'll need to install this library using pip before you can run the script.


```bash
  pip install. requirements.txt
```

## How to prepare the Code
To use the script, simply replace the placeholders your_source_token_here and your_destination_token_here with your actual API access tokens for the respective GitLab instances. You may also need to adjust the URLs of the instances if they are different from the example URLs used in the script.

## Gotta Run
Once you've set everything up, you can run the script using:

```bash
  python git2git.py
```
